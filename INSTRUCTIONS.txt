To run the client/server, follow these steps in order from the codeu_project_2017 directory:

*These commands are executed in a machine running Ubuntu 16.04

1.- ./clean.sh
	Delete all elements inside the bin folder

2.- ./make.sh
	Compiles the project and moves all relevant files to place.

3.- ./database.sh create
	Creates the database file (The server won't run if this step is skipped)

4.- In diferent terminals (both on the codeu_project_2017 directory), execute:
	./run_server.sh test
	
	./run_client.sh test

	The test parameter ensures that the project runs with default parameters, 
	if those don't work on your machine, open the files with a text editor
	for further information on how to add personalized parameters [NO RELAY
	ADDRESS IS USED].

	To test, execute the following command:
	./test.sh

Once in, in the client type the 'help' command or see the Feature Summaries for further information.
